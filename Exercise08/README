Exercise 07: Files and dictionaries
=======

Introduction
--------
Imagine a list as being a numbered sequence of data.

    fish = ["shark", "ray", "halibut", "tuna", "squid"]

The first element is shark, and you access it by its index number:
    print fish[0]
        => shark

To access the nth element, its index number is n-1. The fifth element is accessed thusly:
    print fish[4]
        => squid

What if, instead of a numbered index, we could use a string as an index?
    print fish["deep ocean"]
        => anglerfish
    print fish["shallow river"]
        => candiru

We would then need another way of specifying a list where each element is named.
    fish = {"deep ocean": "anglerfish", "amazon river": "candiru",
            "lake": "bass", "shallow river": "trout"}

This is called a dictionary in python. It's also called a hashtable, or a hashmap, or very non-specifically, a map. A dictionary is a collection of 'key-value pairs'. The key 'deep ocean' _maps_ to the value 'anglerfish'.

Imagine you were writing a program to keep track of user scores in a game. If you only had arrays, you might do something like this:

    names  = ["Bob", "Joe", "Jack", "Jane"]
    scores = [   10,     3,      6,     15]

To find Joe's score, first you'd have to find which position "Joe" is in, then use that position to look up his score.
    index_joe = names.index("Joe")
    print "Joe's score is %d"%(scores[index_joe])
        => Joe's score is 3

This is unwieldy and complicated. With dictionaries, we could instead do the following:
    scores = {"Bob": 10, "Joe": 3, "Jack": 6, "Jane": 15}

    print "Joe's score is %d"%(scores['Joe'])
        => Joe's score is 3 

Dictionaries have a method called 'get' which allows you to have a default value in case a key does not exist beforehand.

    scores = {"Bob": 10, "Joe": 3, "Jack": 6, "Jane": 15}
    print scores.get("Bob", 0) # The second argument is the fallback number if the key doesn't exist
        => 10

    print scores.get("Billy", 0) # Billy doesn't exist in the dictionary, so return the fallback instead
        => 0


Description
-------
In this directory, you will find a text file, scores.txt, containing a series of local restaurant ratings. Each line looks like this:
    
    Restaurant Name:Rating

Your job is to write a program named 'sorted_data.py' reads the file, then spits out the ratings in alphabetical order by restaurant

Sample output:
    Meringue:Exercise07 chriszf$ python sorted_data.py 
    Restaurant 'Andalu' is rated at 3.
    Restaurant "Arinell's" is rated at 4.
    Restaurant 'Bay Blend Coffee and Tea' is rated at 3.
    Restaurant 'Casa Thai' is rated at 2.
    Restaurant 'Charanga' is rated at 3.
    Restaurant 'El Toro' is rated at 5.
    Restaurant 'Giordano Bros' is rated at 2.
    Restaurant "Irma's Pampanga" is rated at 5.
    Restaurant 'Little Baobab' is rated at 1.
    Restaurant 'Pancho Villa' is rated at 3.
    Restaurant 'Taqueria Cancun' is rated at 2.
    Restaurant 'Urbun Burger' is rated at 1.

###SPOILERS LEVEL 1
Identify what you don't know. You have not been asked to open a file and consume its contents yet. You also haven't been asked to use dictionaries yet. You will also need to figure out how to iterate through a dictionary. An important function for iterating through dictionaries is .items()

###SPOILERS LEVEL 2
Start with the smallest thing possible, copy a line out of the scores.txt file and see if you can parse it using split(), then use the resulting tokens to build a dictionary with one item in it.

###SPOILERS LEVEL 3
Using the 'main loop' methodology, make your program repeat the process until it consumes all the lines in the file.

###SPOILERS LEVEL 4
You can't sort a dictionary directly. You can, however, get the list of keys out of a dictionary and sort those. This lets you pull out values one at a time in alphabetical order.

###SPOILERS LEVEL 4
Pseudocode:
    # setup
    create an empty scores dictionary
    open the file 'sorted.txt'
    # main loop
    for each line in the file:
        split the line by the separator ":"
        using the first token as a key, insert the second token into the dictionary as a value

    create a list of keys
    sort the keys
    for each key in the sorted keys:
        print the restaurant name and score
